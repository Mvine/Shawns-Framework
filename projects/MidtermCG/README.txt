Controls:

Hit the arrow keys to move left and right, Wasd gives control over the ball incase you want to test things

It is kinda buggy and sometimes the ball will just bounce right through blocks, or double bounce off the paddle

The score and lives are done using imGui

There are no 2 hit bricks

the ball will respawn in the center of the screen when it falls off the bottom. You don't control when it starts so better think fast.
